                        <strong>License Plate Recognition</strong> is a technology that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automatically read license plate characters. <br/>
                        LPR easily detects and recognize <b>license plates</b> from surveillance video. Lastly, it monitors suspicious activity with simple database searches that reveals the full history of any vehicle that drove past a camera on your property.

                        <strong class="wow animated fadeInLeft slow"> <p>License Plate Recognition has many uses including: </p></strong>
                        <ul class="wow animated fadeInLeft slow">
                            <li>Recovering stolen cars.</li>

                    <p class="wow animated fadeInRight slow"><strong>Face Recognition</strong> 
                        uses the combination of facial features analytics, biometrics and faceprints in
                        order to identify a person. This added video forensics feature contributes greatly to the efficiency and
                        effectiveness of video forensics. It’s function enables added information and data on the user’s end.
